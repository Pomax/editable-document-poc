  <h1>Creating an editable page</h1>
  <main>
    <p>
      This is a text, and the idea is that we can put a cursor in here, even if
      <strong>some content has additional markup</strong>, whether that's
      single-level nested or <strong><em>multiple levels down</em></strong> and
      then just edit content in place, true
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> style. This
      relies on the <code>contenteditable</code> HTML attribute, which lets us
      do a bunch of "what is the caret currently in?" checks, while also working
      on both desktop and mobile. The one thing it <em>does not</em> need,
      though, is a parallel textarea for tracking what you're typing. The
      browser already knows how to do that. Although we'll see if that's still
      true once we add code blocks to the mix. Syntax highlighting makes
      things... weird.
    </p>

    <p>
      And of course, secretly that functionality isn't tied to "these two text
      boxes", it works <strong>everywhere</strong> on this page. You click a
      thing, it's editable, even if the HTML source code didn't say it was.
    </p>
  </main>

  <h2>Some obvious instructions</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>clicking places the cursor</li>
    <li>arrow keys move the cursor</li>
    <li>cursoring out of the element moves focus to the adjacent element</li>
    <li>typing (<em>unsurprisingly</em>) inserts text</li>
    <li>backspace removes to the left of the cursor</li>
    <li>delete removes to the right of the cursor</li>
    <li>cmd/ctrl-A selects all text in the current element</li>
    <li>clicking buttons in the button bar does things</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How?</h2>

  <p>
    HTML elements contain text nodes, and text nodes can be turned into text
    ranges with metrics that reflect the browser's rendered page. That means we
    can keep track of a "cursor" and visualize that with a little red underline,
    while also highlight the "larger block" that text is in by using a range
    that covers the entire text and then highlighting the one or more client
    rects that range covers.
  </p>

  <p>
    So we let the browser do most of the work in terms of editing the content,
    and we provide controls for switching one type of content into another. this
    is of course far from perfect because this is just a proof of concept, but
    it highlights the fact that HTML is pretty uniquely suited to being an
    editable document format.
  </p>

  <h2>But I can't click on links!</h2>

  <p>
    Sure, but that's only because the entire document is currently editable.
    Remove the <code>contenteditable</code> attribute on the body, and it's a
    normal page again. Imagine this being an option you can toggle.
  </p>

  <h2>What's left?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Making the standard WYSIWYG functions work: tag toggling "works", simple
      text wrapping and unwrapping "works", but only with selections (not
      "cursor is on bold text, click to unbold"), and links and image buttons do
      nothing at the moment, but overlap-markup (e.g. bolding across italics)
      makes the code go "I have no idea what I'm doing here so I'll do nothing"
      right now.
    </li>
    <li>
      Adding support for preformatted text blocks ("code blocks") without using
      CodeMirror or the like. We're not "writing" code in this context, we're
      just showing it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Recording changes as some kind of OT/CRDT that can be rolled/played back.
    </li>
    <li>
      Adding some smarts that lets you send those diffs back to your file system
      (e.g., "save" would be pretty crucial to have if we want to edit pages)
    </li>
    <li>
      Make this performant (I have some 50k word documents that this should
      still work with, I don't want "editing the first paragraph" to be fast,
      but "editing the last paragraph" take half an hour in bolding a word)
    </li>
  </ul>
