demo over on https://pomax.github.io/editable-paragraph-element

This is basically a weird mix of "WYSIWYG" and "Markdown" at the moment, as cosmetic markup gets converted to plain text markdown when the cursor is over it, but the WYSIWYG edit bar will still show cosmetic toggle options... not ideal but we'll figure it out.

Also while markdown gets live-converted when you type it, there's a bunch of fun cursor behaviour that isn't ideal atm. Again, we'll figure it out though.
