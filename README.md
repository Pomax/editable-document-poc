Demo over on https://pomax.github.io/editable-document-poc

Special keys (ctrl-... on Windows/Linux, cmd-... on Mac):

- `b` bold (strong)
- `i` italic (emphasis)
- `c` `<code>`

- `1` through `4` make block an h1 through h4
- `p` make block a paragraph
- `e` make block a `<pre>` 
- `o` make block an ordered list
- `u` make block an unordered list (there is no underline. No one use underlines in real writing)

Super special "special key":

- `/` toggle markdown vs HTML for the current block

Feel free to file issues if you have ideas, currently still in the works:

- kinda need a prope undo/redo
- related, kinda need to encode that as OT for "remote" syncing
- show the button bar for block elements
