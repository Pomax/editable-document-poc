demo over on https://pomax.github.io/editable-paragraph-element

feel free to file issues if you have ideas, currently still in the works:

- rewriting this initial code into something generic and reusable.
- better touch support (because I want to be able to write, not just tap)
- selections (keyboard, mouse, and touch)
- content awareness so that things like bold or italic in a paragraph also just use HTML elements.
